  .. collapse:: Relevant Coursework

    * | **YSC4216: Machine Learning**
      | Implemented classical machine learning algorithms such as **K-means, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks** from scratch in **Python**. Utilized **TensorFlow** to build and train deep learning models.
    * | **YSC3236: Functional Programming and Proving**
      | Employed the **Coq Proof Assitant** to show completeness and soundness of specifications, derive formalized proofs for tail-recursive programs, and practiced functional programmnig techniques.
    * | **YSC4217: Mechanized Reasoning**
      | Implemented a compiler and interpreter for numerical and variable expression in **Gallina** and formally proved that interpretting the source code is equivalent to evaluating the compiled code in **Coq**.
